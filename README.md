# Fortified 911
Fortified 911 is my first script ive made after watching some videos!!!

Fortified 911 Features:
/911 - With Webhook Logging!
/twitter
/darkweb
/announce - With Ace Permissions!

I plan on updating it as I learn more to have drawn blips, support for Hamz & Faxes Cad autofill to 911, and more! 

--CONFIG--

server.lua: Change the "CHANGEME" to your 911 webhook.

permissions.cfg: Add the following,

add_ace group.INSERTYOURGROUPHERE "fortifiedstaff" allow

This is for the announce command to work!

Feel free to Fork, As this is brand new code and will need a lot of updates as I learn more!
